    "## Vibe Programming: How did we produce this tutorial? üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a comprehensive set of prompts, structured using the Curriculum Learning technique, that would guide an LLM like me to produce the entire 13-step tutorial, including all the necessary debugging and refinement steps we encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can serve as a template for your students on how to conduct a complex, iterative session to build a full project.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Prompt 1: Initial Context and Role Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation notes:\n",
    "- The prompt was developed using a technique known as Curriculum Learning. In the context of prompt engineering, this approach involves structuring prompts in a way that gradually increases in complexity. The user starts with simpler concepts and progressively introduces more complex ideas and terminology. This method helps the LLM build a solid foundation before tackling more advanced topics, ultimately enabling it to infer and generate new ideas based on its accumulated knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Role--------------------\n",
    "I am a professor of Machine Learning at the college level. You are an experienced Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context (1)----------------\n",
    "This term, I am teaching Foundations of Machine Learning to entry-level students. The topic for this week is Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\n",
    "We want to train a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch using the Dogs vs. Cats dataset, originally from a Kaggle competition, that contains a total of 25,000 labeled images.\n",
    "The Training set consists of:\n",
    "- 10,000 images of cats\n",
    "- 10,000 images of dogs\n",
    "The Test set consists of:\n",
    "- 2,500 images of cats\n",
    "- 2,500 images of dogs\n",
    "This dataset is often used for binary image classification tasks and is popular in deep learning tutorials and competitions.\n",
    "Say if you agree with this information. You may add any other you deem relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Prompt 2: Introducing a Technical Constraint (Data Management)\n",
    "\n",
    "Context (2)----------------\n",
    "But, we are having issues pushing large data sets to GitHub, as GitHub imposes the following limits on file and repository sizes:\n",
    "Soft limit: Files over 50 MB will trigger a warning.\n",
    "Hard limit: Files over 100 MB are blocked from being pushed to the repository.\n",
    "Browser uploads: Limited to 25 MB per file.\n",
    "And there are also Repository Size Limits.\n",
    "Recommended: Keep repositories under 1 GB.\n",
    "Soft cap: GitHub starts issuing warnings if a repository exceeds 1 GB.\n",
    "Hard cap: Repositories over 5 GB may be restricted or flagged for abuse.\n",
    "To manage large files (e.g., datasets, media), GitHub recommends using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS), which allows you to track and store large files outside the regular Git history.\n",
    "Say if you agree with this information. You may add any other you deem relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Prompt 3: Synthesizing Context and Requesting a Project Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Output(1)--------------------\n",
    "You said that, \"While Git LFS is a great tool, it has its own costs and complexities... For a class with many students, this could become a factor. \"\n",
    "And you recommended:\n",
    "DVC is a powerful open-source tool built specifically for machine learning projects... DVC creates small \"pointer\" files that you commit to Git...\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations (1)--------------\n",
    "Guide me step by step on how to implement this project, which I now re-phrase:\n",
    "Train a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch using the Dogs vs. Cats dataset for creating a binary image classification application... The project will use Git alongside DVC, using the former to version the code, and the latter to version the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations (2)--------------\n",
    "Start by listing the steps you will take me through, but not actually implementing them yet.\n",
    "Show me the steps in a table with a step number in column 1, its name in column 2 and a description in column 3.\n",
    "Wait for me to tell you when to start.\n",
    "Show me how to document and implement one step at a time.\n",
    "I will produce a Jupyter Notebook called \"CNN_CatsDogs_Pytorch_GitHub_DVC.ipynb\" where I will add Markdown and Python code cells for every step that you teach me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output-------------------\n",
    "For every step, produce Markdown and Python code that I can easily copy and paste to my notebook in Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me when you are ready to start, and I'll give you the signal to proceed.\n",
