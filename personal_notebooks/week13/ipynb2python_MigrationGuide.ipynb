    "## From Prototype to Production: Architecting Your ML Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You have successfully used a Jupyter Notebook to build, train, and evaluate a complete machine learning model. This is a fantastic achievement and the perfect environment for exploration and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in a data scientist's journey is to learn how to build robust, reusable, and deployable applications. A single notebook, while great for interactive work, can become difficult to manage, test, and integrate into larger systems. The solution is to refactor your code into a structured project directory with modular Python scripts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before you write code, it's important to understand the fundamental rules and best practices that govern real-world machine learning systems. These principles help you avoid common pitfalls and build systems that are simple, reliable, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single best resource for this is Google's renowned guide, which provides concise and battle-tested wisdom from their top ML engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Recommended Guide: Google's \"Rules of Machine Learning\"**\n",

    "### 2\\. The Refactoring Process: Notebook to Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring involves extracting the logical components of your notebook (data processing, training, evaluation) into separate Python scripts. This makes your code modular, easier to test, and ready for automation and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical project structure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "your_project/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── data/              # Data tracked by DVC\n",
    "├── models/            # Models tracked by DVC\n",
    "├── notebooks/         # Your original prototype notebook\n",
    "├── src/               # Your refactored Python source code\n",
    "│   ├── data_processing.py\n",
    "│   ├── train.py\n",
    "│   ├── evaluate.py\n",
    "│   └── predict.py\n",
    "├── app.py             # Your Gradio or Streamlit application\n",
    "├── config.yaml        # Configuration file for parameters\n",
    "└── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies\n",
    "```\n",

    "The following tutorial provides an excellent, step-by-step walkthrough of how to perform this refactoring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Recommended Tutorial: \"How to Structure a Python Project** by freeCodeCamp\n",
    "    This practical guide clearly demonstrates how to move data processing and modeling code out of a notebook, handle configuration files, and structure your project for reproducibility.\n",
